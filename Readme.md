# Sales and Operations Planning Project

In this project, you are going to simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the following data:
- An initial stock level for a product
- The number of month(s) to plan
- The planned sales quantity for each month
Based on this data, calculate the required production quantity as follows:
- If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0
- If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference
Below is an example execution of the program:
>>> Please enter an initial stock level: 500
>>> Please enter the number of months to plan: 5
>>> Please enter the planned sales quantity for month 1: 300
>>> Please enter the planned sales quantity  for month 2: 250
>>> Please enter the planned sales quantity  for month 3: 200
>>> Please enter the planned sales quantity  for month 4: 400
>>> Please enter the planned sales quantity  for month 5: 100
